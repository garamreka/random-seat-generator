<h1>Random Seat Generator</h1>
<p>My classmates at <a href="https://www.en.greenfoxacademy.com/">Green Fox Academy</a> wished to change seats in a random way regularly to get to know each other better and I built this app to automate it. I used <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery</b> to create it.</p>
